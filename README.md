# Smart-Arduino-Cat-Feeder
Smart Arduino Cat Feeder is a simple system using Arduino Uno that is used to feed (in this case a cat) automatically with a timer. In addition, in this simple system we also use a push button as a second option. The push button is used as a manual feeding by the user, if needed.
The system will start the timer automatically when connected to the power, in the timer code is set with an interval of 6 hours. Thus, the servo will move once every 6 hours (you can change this as needed, the code is in milliseconds).
