# Smart-Arduino-Cat-Feeder
Smart Arduino Cat Feeder is a simple system using Arduino Uno that is used to feed (in this case a cat) automatically with a timer. In addition, in this simple system we also use a push button as a second option. The push button is used as a manual feeding by the user, if needed.
